<h2>Goal</h2>

Fitbit had no app / clockface that resembled the rotating image clock face of apple watches and I wanted a solution to that. 
This is a personal solution due to the images needing to be directly imported through code and resources.  


<h2>Installation</h2>

1. Download this project as zip and extract it
2. Import it in Fitbit SDK
3. Ensure Simulator is installed
4. Run program on emulator
