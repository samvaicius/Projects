<h2>Goal</h2>

The lack of an app or clock face that mimicked the visually dynamic rotating image clock face of Apple Watches on Fitbit devices prompted the need for a solution. This project aims to address this gap by utilizing custom code and resources to directly import and display images on the Fitbit device, fulfilling a personal requirement for a more immersive user experience.
